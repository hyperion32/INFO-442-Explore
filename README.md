Facilitating meaningful connections.

# Problem Statement

COVID-19, quarantine, online-schooling, and online work will forever shape the way students interact with others. Instead of being able to interact with others in a physical environment, students are now forced to interact purely through virtual means which can be very difficult when it comes to meeting new people. Social interaction is a pivotal aspect of the college experience as according to Hurst, B., Wallace, R., & Nixon, S. B. (2013). Finding other students with similar interests is a much larger challenge now than ever before as students are quarantined and taking classes from behind a screen. How might we enable students to make meaningful connections with one another in a virtual environment?
